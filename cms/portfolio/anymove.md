AnyMove is the platform for P2P (person-to-person) car sharing. At AnyMove, as a car owner, you can easily and securely rent a car to other private individuals. During the rental period, the car is covered by your insurance partner. As a tenant, AnyMove gives you access to a large number of different cars from private individuals. The keys are handed over between the car owner and the tenant digitally via the AnyMove app.
