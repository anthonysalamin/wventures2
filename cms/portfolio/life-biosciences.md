Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Boston, MA, Life Biosciences is pursuing therapies targeting three molecular pathways that regulate the biology of aging: mitochondrial uncoupling, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and epigenetic reprogramming. Their platform approach enables them to develop pharmaceutical treatments with the potential to prevent, treat, and/or reverse multiple aging-related diseases, each with critical unmet needs.
