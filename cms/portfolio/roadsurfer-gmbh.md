Roadsurfer is a leading platform for outdoor travel. On the rental side, Roadsurfer is characterized by a first-class service and thus logically also by a high level of customer satisfaction. Roadsurfer rents out Bullis, as the newer VW buses are now blasphemously called, so campers, just a “real” motor home. Most use such vehicles, which are built for the road rather than for self-sufficient life, for short trips. Roadsurfer has increased the demand for such buses to become Europe's largest campervan rental company - in just a few years.
