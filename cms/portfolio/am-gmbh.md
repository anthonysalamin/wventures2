For AM GmbH, IT is an ongoing process: IT design and development, sustainable, efficient operation of all solutions with personal 24/7 support, right up to ready-to-use applications from the cloud. AM GmbH is independent of the operating model, because its own cloud architects orchestrate IT operations for customers in their own high-class data centers, in the global clouds and on-premises. For over 10 years, AM GmbH has been looking after satisfied medium-sized and corporate customers from all over Germany from its three locations in Meschede, Dortmund and Hamburg with over 100 committed employees.
